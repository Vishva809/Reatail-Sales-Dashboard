# Methodology

- Data Collection: Imported raw retail sales data from Excel/CSV files.

- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected inconsistent entries, and standardized date formats using Power Query.

- Data Modeling: Created relationships between tables (Products, Sales, Customers, Regions).

- KPI Calculation: Defined key metrics using DAX formulas:

- Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])

- Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])

- Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales])

- Sales Growth % = (Current Month Sales - Previous Month Sales) / Previous Month Sales

- Dashboard Design: Built interactive visuals including:

- Sales Trend Line Chart (Monthly/Yearly)

- Profit and Revenue KPIs

- Product and Regional Performance Bar Charts

- Geo-map for regional sales distribution

- Filters for Date, Product Category, and Customer Segment

- Insight Generation: Interpreted dashboard outcomes to identify growth trends and performance gaps.


7. Insights and Findings
- Top 10 products contributed to nearly 60% of total revenue.
- Certain regions showed high sales but low profit margins, indicating potential pricing or cost inefficiencies.
- Customer segment analysis revealed repeat customers drove 45% of overall revenue.
- Quarterly growth trends showed a 12% increase in sales in the last quarter due to promotional campaigns.

# Results and Impact

- Improved visibility into sales and profit performance across business dimensions.
- Automated dashboard reduced manual reporting time by over 70%.
- Enhanced data-driven decision-making for inventory management and marketing strategy.
- Enabled senior management to monitor business KPIs in real-time.

# Conclusion

- The Retail Sales Dashboard Project successfully demonstrates how data visualization tools like Power BI can transform raw sales data into meaningful business insights. The dashboard serves as a strategic tool for retail managers to track performance, identify key growth areas, and optimize operational decisions.

- Future improvements could include integrating real-time sales data, implementing forecasting models, and expanding the dashboard for multi-store comparison and customer lifetime value analysis.
